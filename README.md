# Installation & Deployment
In order to set up this project you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it) installed, we're currently using Node.js 20.8.0, and [dfx](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/), The DFINITY command-line execution environment tool.  
  
To install `dfx` on a Linux/MacOS machine just type the command:

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```
If you are using a machine running Apple silicon, you will need to have Rosetta installed. You can install Rosetta by running `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.
There is no native support for `dfx` on Windows. However, by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can run dfx also on a Windows system as described below.

Since some currency is required to deploy a canister it is reccommended to setup a cycle wallet with some cycles in it either from the [faucet quick start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/cycles/cycles-faucet) or by purchasing ICP and following the IC [mainnet deployment](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-mainnet) guide.

Please take your time to do all this steps before proceeding further.

## Installing requirements
First open a terminal in the parent directory of the project and run:

```batch
npm i
```

this will install all the required packages.
## Setting local environment variables
create a file in the parent directory called `.env` and put your wallet private key inside as follow:

```
PRIVATE_KEY="<private-key>"
```
## Deploy the smart contracts on Bitfinity Network
Once you're good with the previous steps it's time to deploy the smart contract. We used the hardhat framework so the deploy is very easy, just execute this command in the parent folder of the project:

```batch
npx hardhat run --network bitfinityTest scripts/deploy.js
```

it's possible to change the destination network (we used the bitfinity test network for the scope of this project) specifing a new network in the hardhat.config.ts configuration file such as:

```
networks: {
    bitfinity: {
      chainId: 355110,
      url: "https://mainnet.bitfinity.network",
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  }
```

Just be sure to provide the private key of a wallet with a sufficient amount of BFT or the currency token of the network you're deploying in.

## Deploy the Canister with the website on IC.
The deploy of the static website is pretty simple. Let's start configuring the `dfx.json` file which should be somithing like:

```
{
   "canisters": {
       "fairfounds": {
           "type": "assets",
           "source": ["assets"]
       }
   }
}
```

To add eventual asset folders you want to include add those to the source configuration. also don't forget to change the website name if you want to.
If you're not changing the project structure the configuration file will work just fine as it is. The deploy of the website is done with `dfx` live on the Interet Computer network:

```
dfx deploy --network playground
```

if you want to deploy the application on the mainnet change the flag in `--network ic`, or change it to `--network local` if you want to try it in local.
### Check out the website
first search the canister ID running:

```
dfx canister --network playground id fairfounds
```

As always change the flag if you deployed on a different network and take note of the return value that should looks something like `cbopz-duaaa-aaaaa-qaaka-cai` which is the canister ID.

The website is now accessible at https://canister-id.icp0.io

# How our product works
Our factory smart contract duty is to generate the single campaign-related smart contracts. this last are collected in the registry of the fundraising campaigns.

Each campaign smart contract collect in another registry all the useful information about the received donations.

A really important field is the minimum goal. Once reached the owner of the initiative will be enabled to withdraw all the BFTs owned by the smart contract. When the funds are withdrawn an NFT for each donators is minted and sent as a reward.

After reaching the minimum goal the owner can withdraw the BFTs as soon as theyâ€™re available, also at project closure all the pending BFTs are sent to the owner as well.

If the minimum goal is never reached and the deadline in time is met all the BFTs owned by the smart contract are refunded to the donators and no NFT will be minted.
